If you're just interested in seeing the archive, this GitHub project page is the best spot at the moment: https://charliepark.github.com/mathowielove/

Back in 2009, internet buddy Matt Haughey tweeted that he had been diagnosed with a tumor: "I passed out at home had a seizure, went to ER, did a cat scan and they found a growth. Awaiting surgery in the next week to remove it." Anil Dash suggested that folks write tweets about what Matt meant to them. Over a thousand did. (Matt's doctors were able to successfully treat the tumor, by the way.)

Back in the early days, Twitter's search wasn't great, and was also only good for the previous 12 months. Over time, tweets started to fade. Matt wrote "Sad the original #mathowielove tweets are gone from Twitter Search. @ev you're kinda building a cultural artifact here, db issues be damned".

Some friends and I decided to gather the tweets together in one spot for Matt. This repo is an archive of them, in the format of an HTML page.

Thanks to Marc Hedlund, Nelson Minar, Anil Dash, Mark Trammell, Ryan Sarver, Gloria Fumagalli, Jodee Rich, and Marco Arment for their help in pulling this together.
