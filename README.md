# mathowielove

Back in 2009, internet buddy Matt Haughey shared that he had been diagnosed with a tumor. Anil Dash suggested that folks write tweets about what Matt meant to them. Over a thousand did.

At the time, Twitter's search wasn't great, and was also only good for the previous 12 months. Over time, they started to fade. Matt wrote "Sad the original #mathowielove tweets are gone from Twitter Search. @ev you're kinda building a cultural artifact here, db issues be damned".

Some friends and I decided to gather them together in one spot for Matt. This repo is an archive of it.

Thanks to Marc Hedlund, Nelson Minar, Anil Dash, Mark Trammell, Ryan Sarver, Gloria Fumagalli, Jodee Rich, and Marco Arment for their help in pulling this together.
